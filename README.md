Code Review Marketplace

Welcome to the Code Review Marketplace project! This is a web-based platform where less experienced developers can connect with experienced developers for code reviews and consultations. The marketplace allows experienced developers to create profiles, list their skills and hourly rates, and offer their services to help other developers improve their code. Less experienced developers can browse these profiles, select a developer for help, and schedule a code review session, all while handling payments securely through the platform.

Features

User Authentication: Secure authentication using GitHub OAuth via NextAuth.js.
Developer Profiles: Experienced developers can create profiles, list their skills, hourly rate, and availability.
Matching System: Less experienced developers can search for experienced developers based on skills and rates.
Real-Time Chat: Users can communicate via chat before scheduling a session.
Payments: Secure payment processing using Stripe. The platform takes a 20% cut from each transaction.
Zoom Integration: Once a session is booked and paid for, a Zoom meeting is automatically scheduled.
Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js
Backend: Node.js and Express (with Next.js API routes)
Database: MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas or local instance)
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Payment Processing: Stripe
Video Conferencing: Zoom API
Hosting: GitPod for development, Vercel or Netlify for deployment
Getting Started

To run this project locally or in GitPod, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Git
Node.js
GitPod or local development environment
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-review-marketplace.git
cd code-review-marketplace
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
# GitHub OAuth (get these from GitHub)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

# Stripe API keys (get these from Stripe)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key

# Zoom OAuth credentials (get these from Zoom Marketplace)
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your-zoom-client-id
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your-zoom-client-secret
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Or your production URL

# MongoDB (use your MongoDB connection string)
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
4. Start the development server
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open the app at http://localhost:3000.

5. Launch in GitPod
If you prefer to run the project in GitPod, simply navigate to your repository and prepend https://gitpod.io/# to the URL of your GitHub repository.

For example:

bash
Copy code
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/yourusername/code-review-marketplace
6. Deploy the App
You can easily deploy this app to Vercel or Netlify. Both platforms integrate with GitHub, so you can deploy your project directly from your repository.

Vercel: Visit Vercel, import your GitHub project, and deploy with a few clicks.
Netlify: Visit Netlify, link your GitHub repository, and deploy.
How It Works

1. Authentication
Users sign in using their GitHub account via NextAuth.js.
2. Developer Profiles
Experienced developers create profiles that list their skills, hourly rate, and availability.
Less experienced developers create profiles that describe their needs.
3. Matching and Booking
Less experienced developers search for experienced developers based on their skills and rates.
They can message the developer to discuss the task before booking.
4. Payments
The platform uses Stripe for secure payments.
The less experienced developer pays the hourly rate into an escrow account, and the platform takes a 20% commission.
5. Zoom Integration
After the payment is made, a Zoom meeting is automatically scheduled for the session.
